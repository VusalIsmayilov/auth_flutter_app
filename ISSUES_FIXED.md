# Issues Fixed - Phone Number & Email Verification

## ✅ Issue 1: Phone Number Not Persisting - FIXED

### **Problem:**
- Phone number entered during registration or profile update would disappear after login
- Backend was not storing/returning firstName, lastName, phoneNumber properly

### **Root Cause:**
- Backend `RegisterEmailRequest` only accepts `Email` and `Password`
- Backend `UserInfo` DTO doesn't include `FirstName`, `LastName` fields
- Flutter app was sending extra data that backend ignored

### **Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced Flutter app to store firstName, lastName, phoneNumber locally during registration
- Updated profile update logic to persist phone number locally
- Added better logging for local data enhancement

### **Result:**
✅ Phone numbers now persist across logins
✅ Profile updates are saved locally
✅ Display name includes firstName/lastName properly

## ⚠️ Issue 2: Email Verification - PARTIALLY FIXED

### **Problem:**
- "Verify Email" functionality not working
- Users not receiving verification emails
- Resend verification not working

### **Root Cause:**
- Backend endpoints exist and work correctly (`/api/auth/verify-email`, `/api/auth/resend-verification`)
- Backend responds: "Unable to send verification email. Email may already be verified or not found"
- **Backend email service (SMTP/SendGrid) is not configured**

### **What's Working:**
✅ Verification endpoints respond correctly
✅ Flutter app UI handles verification flow properly
✅ Token validation works (returns appropriate error for invalid tokens)

### **What Needs Backend Configuration:**
❌ SMTP/SendGrid email service configuration
❌ Email templates for verification emails
❌ Email sending functionality

### **Temporary Workaround:**
- Verification UI is functional
- If backend email service gets configured, verification will work immediately
- Users can manually verify through backend admin if needed
